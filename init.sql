-- Database initialization script
-- This will be run when the PostgreSQL container starts for the first time
-- Note: The actual schema is managed by Prisma migrations

-- Create the exchange database if it doesn't exist
-- (This is already handled by POSTGRES_DB environment variable)

-- You can add any additional initialization here if needed
-- For example: CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp";

-- The schema will be created by running: npx prisma migrate dev
